Our Mission
The Developing Foundation Inc. was founded

appropriate treatment for a family member with
a brain injury or a developmental disability.
We provide development and brain injury support
which helps children and adults reach their
potential.
This is achieved through;
• Funding of vital aids, therapy and equipment
• Information resources and support programs
• Early intervention programs and services
• Research into the most effective treatment
for brain injury and developmental disability
