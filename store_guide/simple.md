## Volunteer Roles

There are five (5) volunteer 'roles'. On each shift, please choose a role and accomplish as much as you can. You may switch roles whenever you like. The roles are:

#### Customer Service
This involves watching the Front Counter and serving customers.

#### Pricing & Putting Out
This involves bringing bags marked as Good Stock to the Front Counter, pricing Good Stock according to the Simple Pricing Guide, and putting this Good Stock out instore. 

#### Stock Rotation
This involves checking the dates on stock. If the date is 2 weeks old, the item is Red Slashed down to half price. If an item is 1 month old, it is either re-priced at $2 and moved to the Bargain Room or discarded.

#### Visual Merchandising
This involves redecorating displays and mannequins with Good and Great Stock.

#### Sorting Stock
Sorting Stock involves sorting New Donations into the Wastebaskets marked "Good", and "Rubbish/Recycle" and moving them to their appropriate areas.

## How to Choose a Role
### It depends on how many people are on-shift, 
If one (1) volunteer is on shift, they should focus on Customer Service and the Daily Routine Tasks.

If two (2) volunteers are on shift, one (1) should focus on Customer Service and one (1) should focus on Sorting New Donations or Pricing and Putting Out Good Stock.

If three (3) volunteers are on shift, one (1) should focus on Customer Service; one (1) should focus on Pricing and Putting Out Good Stock; and one (1) should focus on Sorting Stock in the Back Sorting Area.

Each additional volunteer should help in Sorting Stock in the Back Sorting Area.

## We also have ‘decision flow charts’ to guide us,
Two (2) decision flow charts are provided in the following pages. This is a quick guide on how to read them to always know what you can be doing to help.
### Front Counter
If the daily routines are covered, then price and put out new stock.
If there is no room to put out new stock, then rotate month-old stock.
If there is no sorted stock, then sort new donation or assist customers or visual merchandise
### Back Area
If the daily routines are covered, then Sort New Stock
If there is no room for good stock, then take good stock out to the front counter
If there is no room for bargain stock, then discard bargain stock into the bins
If there is no room for rubbish stock in bins, then move rubbish around the side, behind the shed.

## Customer Service
The Yesterdays Thrift stores - like much of traditional Paddington - are friendly and relaxed. Being helpful and polite to customers is important. 

A friendly hello is often enough; if you feel like chatting, even better. And assisting customers with their shopping is an excellent way to make them feel welcome and well served.

**The standard procedure for processing a sale goes as follows:**

1.	Greet the customer as they approach the counter.
2.	Enter each sale item into the Point-of-Sale (PoS) program.
3.	Quote the total price to the customer.
4.	Receive the customer's money, put it in the till, and give them their change. A change calculator will be displayed in the PoS at the end of the sale.
5.	Ask the customer if they would like a bag.
6.	If a customer brings homewares or anything else that might break or chip, offer to wrap them in newspaper.
7.	If a customer purchases jewellery, offer to put the jewellery in tissue paper.
8.	If a customer asks to use EFTPOS, simply enter the total sale amount into the EFTPOS machine, press Enter twice, and then invite the customer to use their card. Afterwards, tear off the first receipt, place it into the till, and ask the customer if they would like a copy.

## Pricing & Putting Out 
After being sorted, donations are priced according to the Simple Pricing Guide.

**For Bargain Stock,** items are hung onto the racks in the Bargain Room with $2 price tags.**

**For apparel,** prices are written in pen onto both sides of cardboard tags. These tags are then attached to clothing labels using a small, plastic tag gun. If an item of clothing has no labels, then the tags are attached through stitching or a button hole. If neither are available, tags with string loops can be used to tie tags onto apparel. Each tag must be dated in small handwriting (dd-mm) beside the word and symbol “Check ->”.

**For jewellery,** prices are written onto tags with string loops that are tied onto the jewellery. Each tag must be dated in small handwriting (dd-mm) beside the word and symbol “Check ->”.

**For books,** prices are written in pencil onto the top-left corner of the first non-colour page of the book. Books are not dated by hand. Date of entry is recorded by the Yesterdays Database app when scanned into the system through the PoS.

**For other items,** prices are written onto small stickers which are placed onto items in a way that is easy to find, but does not detract from the visual appeal of the item. Each tag must be dated in small handwriting (dd-mm) beside the word and symbol “Check ->”.

**After being priced,** stock should be put out onto the sales floor as soon as possible. The pace at which donations are put out onto the sales floor should match the pace at which donations are sorted.

***

## Stock Rotation
To make sure stock keeps flowing, any stock that doesn't sell within 2 weeks is reduced to half price and any stock that doesn't sell after 1 month is either untagged and moved to the Bargain Room or discarded.

Whenever the Sales Floor is full and there is Good Stock ready, please rotate stock to make room on the Sales Floor.

**How to Rotate Stock:**

•	Start anywhere in store and look for 2 week-old stock

•	Find stock with price tags that have dates older than 2 weeks

•	Use a red pen to draw a line through the old price

•	Write the new, half price on the tag

•	Place stock back on the rack

•	If the stock is 1 month old, it is either tagged at $2 and moved to the Bargain Room or discarded

## Merchandising
Each day, around noon, displays and mannequins are reviewed to ensure that they are attractive with new stock.

### Rules of Thumb
•	Rooms should feel open and spacious.

•	Each mannequin should have 2-5 items (top, bottom, belt, jewellery, and/or hat). 

•	Items displayed on flat surfaces should remain 1 inch apart.

•	The Front Window boxes should have 1-3 items. Each item should be clearly visible 

  from the sidewalk.

### Visual elements to consider:
•	Texture

•	Theme

•	Movement

•	Narrative

•	Colour

•	Height

•	White space

•	Eye level

***

## Sorting Stock
Donations are sorted into three (3) categories: Great, Good and Rubbish/Recycle. Each category (except Great) has a corresponding waste-basket. Each waste-basket is lined with large, black bags. After filling a waste-basket with appropriately sorted donations, the large, black bags are tied up and placed in good stock area.  Rubbish/Recycle, which is simply discarded.

### Great
These are unique, striking, or exceptionally valuable donations. These donations should be taken directly to the front counter to be priced and put on display.

### Good
These are donations that a reasonable person would purchase for the minimum price listed in the appropriate Simple Pricing Guide. These donations are put in bags marked "Good" and placed into the Good Stock area.

### Bargain
These are donations that a reasonable person would purchase for less than the lowest price listed in the appropriate pricing guide. These donations are sorted into the Good Stock Area.

### Rubbish/Recycle
Anything dirty, broken, electrical, or unsafe should be carefully discarded in the appropriate bin. If an item or container is very unpleasant or unsafe, please contact management for disposal. If the bins become full, please place Rubbish in the Rubbish Storage area.
